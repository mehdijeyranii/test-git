                <hr>
                <p>
                    I am a passionate learner and developer with an interest in
                    front-end technologies, React, and TypeScript. I'm currently
                    expanding my knowledge in web development and scripting,
                    while also diving into PHP and Git for version control.
                </p>
                <p>
                    I love working on creative projects, solving problems, and
                    constantly improving my skills. In addition to technical
                    expertise, I'm also improving my English to enhance my
                    communication in international communities.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Feel free to connect with me for collaboration or knowledge
                    sharing!
                </p>
